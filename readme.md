Things I am working on:

- add the additional data to the dataset with less time so it pushes the TVL with less info to the right hand side

- incorporate the Log and Auto (linear) chart type button

- add the option to change timeframe

- add the button to include or exclude double count and liquid staking

Context for the TVL URL:
-> the TVL includes: liquid staking and double counted TVL
